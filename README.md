# Hi, I'm CosmosExmo 🐝 👨🏻‍💻


I'm a application developer mainly focusing on Flutter and some experience with Swift UI. I have used technologies like Firebase(Firestore, Functions, Storage, Messaging), developed Rest API's using PHP, nodeJS, used Socket IO for live location sharing between client apps. I am highly motivated to try out new things and eager to learn in the process.
